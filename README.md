# Word Capitalization Tool

This project was created for my Principles of Programming Languages class (COMP348 - Winter 2025).

It is built using C and demonstrates concepts such as
- file I/O
- string manipulation
- traversing file directories

## Features
- search different directories for a target word
- capitalizes the target word in each file
- create a report that counts each capitalization and how many times it occurs in each file

## How to Run
1. download or clone the repository
2. open a terminal window and navigate to the project folder
3. compile the program: gcc replace.c traversal.c text.c report.c -o WordCapitalizationTool
4. run the program with the target word: ./WordCapitalizationTool targetWord
